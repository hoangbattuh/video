# Video Editor Pro - Debugging Solution

## Problem Summary

The application was failing to start due to missing system dependencies required by Electron on Linux systems.

**Error:** `libnss3.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

## Root Cause

Electron requires the NSS (Network Security Services) library and other system dependencies that are not available in minimal Linux environments or containers.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Electron Startup Script (`start-app.js`)

- Added comprehensive error handling and diagnostics
- Implemented multiple Electron startup flags for better compatibility
- Provides clear error messages and solution guidance

### 2. Web-Based Development Mode

- Created `webpack.dev.js` configuration for browser-based development
- Added `npm run dev-web` script for web development without Electron
- Configured webpack dev server on port 3000

### 3. Updated Package Scripts

```json
{
  "start": "node start-app.js",
  "start-electron": "electron . --no-sandbox --disable-dev-shm-usage",
  "start-dev": "webpack && node start-app.js",
  "dev-web": "webpack serve --config webpack.dev.js",
  "build-web": "webpack --config webpack.dev.js --mode production",
  "build": "webpack"
}
```

## Current Status: âœ… WORKING

The application is now running successfully in web development mode at http://localhost:3000/

## How to Fix the Original Electron Issue

### For Ubuntu/Debian Systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libnss3 libnss3-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libxss-dev
```

### For Docker Environments:

Add to your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libnss3 libnss3-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev libxss-dev libasound2-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### For Production Deployment:

1. Install system dependencies on the target system
2. Use `npm start` for Electron desktop application
3. Use `npm run dev-web` for browser-based development
4. Use `npm run build-web` for production web build

## Development Workflow

### Web Development (Recommended for development):

```bash
npm run dev-web
```

This starts a webpack dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:3000/

### Electron Development (After installing system deps):

```bash
npm run start-dev
```

This builds the app and starts Electron with additional compatibility flags.

## Files Modified/Created

1. **`start-app.js`** - Enhanced startup script with error handling
2. **`webpack.dev.js`** - Web development configuration
3. **`package.json`** - Updated scripts for multiple development modes
4. **`INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive installation and troubleshooting guide
5. **`DEBUGGING_SOLUTION.md`** - This solution summary

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate development**: Use the web mode (`npm run dev-web`) which is currently working
2. **For production deployment**: Install the required system dependencies
3. **For containerized deployment**: Use the provided Docker instructions
4. **For desktop application**: Install system dependencies and use `npm start`

The application is now in a working state and can be developed using the web-based mode while the system dependencies issue can be resolved separately.
